# josephus

## Josephus Problem

The program takes in 2 parameters: the number of people in the circle (n) and the step rate (k).
It outputs the last person left place number.


There are two program variants - josephus.pl (uses splice function to remove array members) and josephus1.pl ( changes place numbers to zero - easier to rewrite to other languages) 

Run program with two arguments, where NUMBERs are positive integers :

perl josephus.pl -n NUMBER -k NUMBER
